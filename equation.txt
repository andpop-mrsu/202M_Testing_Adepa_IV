Checklist for Quadratic Equation Solver
=======================================

1. **Two distinct real roots**
   - Input: a = 1, b = -3, c = 2
   - Expected Output: [1.0, 2.0]
   - Description: Standard case where the equation has two real roots.

2. **One real root (double root)**
   - Input: a = 1, b = -2, c = 1
   - Expected Output: [1.0]
   - Description: Discriminant is zero, resulting in one real root.

3. **No real roots (negative discriminant)**
   - Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 5
   - Expected Output: []
   - Description: Discriminant is negative, meaning no real roots.

4. **Zero coefficient b**
   - Input: a = 1, b = 0, c = -4
   - Expected Output: [-2.0, 2.0]
   - Description: Quadratic equation with a missing linear term.

5. **Zero coefficient c**
   - Input: a = 1, b = -4, c = 0
   - Expected Output: [0.0, 4.0]
   - Description: Quadratic equation where one root is zero.

6. **Non-quadratic case (a = 0)**
   - Input: a = 0, b = 2, c = -3
   - Expected Output: Error (ValueError)
   - Description: Invalid quadratic equation case (division by zero avoided).
